#Dukedoms of Daleria - Archives

Microservice to hold card data for Dukedoms of Daleria.

##Setup:

Use the included Vagrantfile to provision a vagrant environment for development purposes. By default, the configuration
maps guest port 8000 to host port 4567. 

##Django and Vagrant Notes:
If using Django's runserver, make sure you tell it to bind to 0.0.0.0:8000 to show up on your host machine.
